Data Journalism and D3

This assignment provides us the task of a data visualization position for a major metro paper.
A real world example of analyzing current trends that shape people's lives and creating the charts, graphs and interactive elements to help understand the findings. This provides a specific story using information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set is based on 2014 American Community Surveys 1 year estimates for individual states and their associated percentage rates of poverty, lacking healthcare, etc.

Our assignment focused on the correlation between poverty and lack of healthcare. The scatter plot provides those data points shown as circles with the State's abbreviations inside. Our plot also attaches d3 tooltips to the individual circles, using event listener's to provide the exact percentages for the state when clicked upon. Event listener's then hide the tooltip data once the mouse is no longer on that circle. A function is also used to resize our graph depending on the browser window size. This allows for a more responsive sizing of the graph for a better user experience.
